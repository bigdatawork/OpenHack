# Overview

This OpenHack enables attendees to build a Power App that leverages the Dynamics 365 Education Accelerator and key parts of the Power Platform, including Power Automate, AI Builder, Power BI, Connectors, Power Virtual Agent, and the Dataverse, while also integrating with Microsoft Teams and Azure. This OpenHack simulates a real-world scenario where Evergreen Elementary School is about halfway through their school year and has long been a leader in implementing new digital initiatives.  As part of their digital transformation journey, Evergreen has implemented the Dynamics 365 Education Accelerator in order to provide their staff with a holistic student profile and facilitate better communication between the school, the students and their families.  In order to further extend their implementation, Evergreen Elementary School’s administration has requested a new round of improvements to their system. 
During the “hacking” attendees will focus on creating a Power App for teachers to better manage students and linking it to the Dataverse, building a custom connector and linking it to Azure Cognitive Services, using AI Builder to build an AI model, creating Power BI queries and visuals to satisfy reporting needs, scripting a chatbot with Power Virtual Agents, creating an integration between Microsoft Teams and the Dynamics 365 Education Accelerator app, and migrating their work across environments to meet ALM best practices.  By the end of the OpenHack, attendees will have built out a technical solution that serves as an all-encompassing solution for the modern teacher in the digital age, built on the building blocks of the Power Platform.

## Option 2: 30-day Trial Environment

### How to set up a Dynamics 365 Trial and create your Power Platform tenant


1.  Open a web browser and navigate to [trials.dynamics.com](https://trials.dynamics.com/) and click
    "Sign up here".

    > Note: *If you are already logged in with another Microsoft 365 account, you
    may need to open an incognito browser.*

1.  You will get a pop-up asking you if you are a partner or Microsoft
    employee. Always try to be honest, but in this case we're going to
    click "no and continue signing up" so that we can see the full
    experience.

    ![](images/image4.png)

1.  Enter your email address, then provide the necessary information
    required. You must provide a phone number where you can either be
    texted or called with a verification code to prove that you are not
    a robot.

    ![](images/image5.png)

1.  Once the code is verified, you will be able to create your new
    domain, which will be the unique name used to identify your Dynamics
    365 tenant. Finish creating your business identity user and sign up.

1.  You will then be able to navigate to your newly created tenant.

1.  Select at least one first party app to get started with (you can
    select more later if you wish). This will complete your setup.

    *\*You could also select none if none of these apps meet your business needs.*

    ![](images/image8.png)

1.  You will then be navigated to your newly created tenant. From here,
    you can open the menu in the upper left-hand corner to navigate to
    the Admin center to continue your setup.
